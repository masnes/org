Ok that this setter-ish-thing doesn't accept null?
ProjectDetails.java:227 
addScan(@Nonnull Scan scan) { 
    if (scan == null) {
        return;
    }
    m_scans.add(scan
Answer: It's probably best to throw an error on null, but this is OK.

- Can Setup vpn access
  - Will probably take 4-5 days
  - Server is headless
  - John is setting up workbench etc.
- Is interested in LRM
  - Adam is giving them a free trial.
    - Want to push pseudolocalization, but need permission from devs to commit to code.
- John likes us (Loyd too). They feel like we're going above and beyond.
  - John is slow to get things moving
    - Loyd is pressuring him though.
- John's interaction with developers:
  - Really annoyed with his developers.
  - Doesn't have much power over the developers.
